## üí° About the Project

This portfolio demonstrates my proficiency in **advanced React architecture** (specifically custom state management with Hooks), **build-time data processing**, and **modern, performance-focused CSS methodologies**.

### Key Features:

  * **Modular Component Design:** Built with React following a component-driven architecture for scalability, organizing distinct sections like Projects and Blog Posts into reusable, focused components.
  * **Fully Responsive & Routed:** Features client-side routing (via React Router) for a seamless single-page experience, combined with a mobile-first responsive design using modern CSS for optimal viewing on any device.
  * **Custom Data Sourcing (Blog):** Implements a bespoke blog system that demonstrates build-time data processing by dynamically loading and parsing local Markdown files via Webpack and `gray-matter`
  * **Centralized State Management:** Utilizes React's useContext hook and a dedicated Provider to serve the parsed and sorted blog posts to any component, demonstrating a clean and scalable approach to managing application data.
